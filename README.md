# Todo-List
As part of The Odin Project curriculum (TOP), I made a Todo-list with ES6 modules. 

Features
- View all projects
- View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedateâ€¦ perhaps changing color for different priorities).
- Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.
- Delete a todo.

Future feature ideas to implement.
- Sort by date / priority.
- Create logins and allow shared projects / notes between users.
